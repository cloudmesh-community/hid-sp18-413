Puppet \cite{WhatisPuppet} is designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like
and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively. The user describes system resources
and their state, either using Puppet's declarative language or a Ruby DSL
(domain-specific language).  This information is stored in files called
\index{Manifest} `Puppet manifests'. Puppet discovers the system informatio via
a utility called \index{facter} Facter, and compiles the Puppet manifests into a
system-specific catalog containing resources and resource dependency, which are
applied against the target systems. Any actions taken by Puppet are then
reported.  The Puppet \index{kubernetes} kubernetes module
\cite{KubernetesModule} installs and configures the Kubernetes system which
arranges containers into logical units to improve management and discovery.This
module installs and configures Kubernetes. Kubernetes is an open-source system
for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical
units for easy management and discovery.
