Waikato \cite{ Weka }. Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) is a suite of
machine learning software written in Java, developed at the \index{Waikato}
University of Waikato, New Zealand. It is free software licensed under the
\index{GNU} GNU. Weka contains a collection of visualization tools and
algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical
user interfaces for easy access to these functions.  The original nonJava
version of Weka was a \index{TCL} Tcl/Tk front-end to (mostly third-party)
modeling algorithms implemented in other programming languages, plus data
preprocessing utilities in C, and a Makefile-based system for running machine
learning experiments \cite{ Wiki-Weka }.
