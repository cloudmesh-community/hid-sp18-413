Clojure~\cite{hid-sp18-413-clojure} is a fully functional scripting
language. Although it is a complied programming language, all its
features are available at runtime. Clojure is based on
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_s
  (programming_language)}{lisp} and uses the same eco system. It
provides access to \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_s
  (programming_language)}{Java} framework including hints and type
inference. Clojureâ€™s main advantage is its implementation of
multithreaded programming.Clojure very efficiently breaks a task into
subtasks and places them on different JVM threads for parallel
processing. Parallel programming has three challenges called three
goblins; reference cells, mutual exclusion and dwarves berserkers and
Clojure handles them by implementing three tools called futures,
delays and promises.
