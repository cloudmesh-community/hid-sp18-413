\section{Logicalglue}

Logicalglue~\cite{hid-sp18-413-logicalglue} is a predictive analystics software
that is mostly targeted towards insurance sector. It employs fuzzy logic to
generate rules which in turn derive accurate predictions. Logcalglue employs
machine learning and genetic algorithms to generate outcomes. New and dynamic
data can be fed to the model generated and analysis can be run in realtime. This
model accurately works on complete lifecycle of a project right from customers
acquisition to closure.
