Zeppelin \cite{Zeppelin} is a modern web-based tool for the data scientists to
collaborate over large-scale data exploration and visualization projects. It is
a notebook style \index{interpreter} interpreter that enable collaborative
analysis sessions sharing between users. Zeppelin is independent of the
execution framework itself \cite{notebooks}. Current version runs on top of
Apache \index{spark} Spark but it has pluggable interpreter APIs to support
other data processing systems. More execution frameworks could be added at a
later date i.e Apache Flink, Crunch as well as SQL-like backends such as Hive,
Tajo, MRQL.
