\section{Weka}

Weka~\cite{hid-sp18-413-Weka} is a machine learning environment that provides
grapical interface. It has a library of machine learning algorithms for data
mining tasks.It was developed in Waikato university New
Zealand. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)}{Python}
and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)}{R} have
advanced tools for machine learning but can be difficult to learn specially for
a beginner and Weka makes this transition easier. Weka is written in Java and has
its own API\@. All tasks performed with GUI can be also performed in CLI@\@. It's GUI
has Explorer to learn, experimenter to run experiments and Knowledge flow to
build pipelines for actual implementations.
